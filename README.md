# Task2
# Student Grade Calculator

This project is a simple and interactive Python program that calculates a student's grade based on marks entered by the user.
It uses a custom grading scale: O, A+, A, B+, B, C, and provides an encouraging message for each grade.

# Features
✔ Custom Grade Scale

The program uses the following grading system:

Marks                    	Grade

90–100	                       O

85–89	                       A+

75–84	                       A

65–74	                       B+

55–64	                       B

Below 55	                   C

✔ Encouraging Messages

Each grade is paired with a helpful and positive message to motivate learners.

✔ Input Validation

Ensures users enter only valid marks between 0 and 100.

✔ Simple and Beginner-Friendly

Clear instructions, easy to understand, no unnecessary complications.

# How to Run
